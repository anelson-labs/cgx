# Shitty Github Actions support for ARM runners on personal plans has forced me to host
# this repo in an org on a paid Teams plan.  In this org I have created the following "custom" runners, which are still
# Github-hosted and managed, but appear as custom runners:
# - `ubuntu-24.04-arm64` - 2-core · 8 GB RAM · 75 GB SSD
# - `windows-11-arm64` - 4-core · 16 GB RAM · 150 GB SSD
#
# Dist needs to be told to use these
