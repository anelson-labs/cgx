    /// - `cargo run`: Uses the `--` delimiter approach (`cargo run -- args`), which is more
    ///   explicit but less convenient for repeated use.
    ///
    /// # Algorithm
    ///
    /// The function scans arguments left-to-right, tracking which arguments are flags
    /// and which are flag values. The first argument that is neither a flag nor a flag
    /// value is identified as the crate spec, and serves as the split point.
    ///
    /// For compatibility, if an explicit `--` delimiter is present, it is used as the
    /// split point instead.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// ```text
    /// cgx ripgrep --version
    ///  cgx args: ["cgx", "ripgrep"]
    ///  binary args: ["--version"]
    ///
    /// cgx --features foo ripgrep --color=always -i
    ///  cgx args: ["cgx", "--features", "foo", "ripgrep"]
    ///  binary args: ["--color=always", "-i"]
    ///
    /// cgx --path ./foo mycrate --help
    ///  cgx args: ["cgx", "--path", "./foo", "mycrate"]
    ///  binary args: ["--help"]
